# 🧱 LEGO Builder's Code of Conduct

## Our LEGO Castle Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our LEGO castle project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Just like building with LEGO bricks, we believe that every piece matters and every builder has something valuable to contribute! 🏰

## Our Building Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive LEGO building environment include:

* 🤝 **Helping Fellow Builders**: Using welcoming and inclusive language
* 🎨 **Respecting Different Building Styles**: Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* 📝 **Accepting Constructive Feedback**: Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* 🎯 **Community First**: Focusing on what is best for the LEGO community
* 👥 **Builder Empathy**: Showing empathy towards other community members
* 🔧 **Sharing Knowledge**: Helping others learn and grow their building skills
* 🌟 **Celebrating Success**: Acknowledging and celebrating contributions from all builders

Examples of unacceptable behavior by LEGO builders include:

* ❌ The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* ❌ Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* ❌ Public or private harassment
* ❌ Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* ❌ Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* ❌ Deliberately breaking or sabotaging the LEGO builds of others

## Our Castle Responsibilities

Project maintainers (our Master Builders) are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Master Builders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any builder for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Building Together - Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting Broken Bricks (Enforcement)

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at the repository maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## LEGO Philosophy Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, and infused with the BondIT ApS LEGO building philosophy - where every piece matters and systematic thinking leads to great builds!
