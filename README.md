## 🔤 Building Translation Solutions, One Brick at a Time

Welcome to Open XLIFF Translator - where we do for translation workflows what LEGO did for building: make them structured, reliable, and surprisingly enjoyable!

Just like assembling a LEGO masterpiece, we've crafted a solution that transforms complex XLIFF translation workflows into something elegant and straightforward. This Dockerized web-based translation tool uses **FastAPI**, **async Python**, and **LibreTranslate** to create a seamless translation experience. Upload your XLIFF files, watch the magic happen, and download your translated content - all with the precision and reliability you'd expect from a well-engineered LEGO creation.

## 🚀 Features - The Building Blocks

- **📄 XLIFF Translation Magic** – Automatically translate `.xlf` files to different languages, like having a universal translator in your LEGO toolkit
- **⚡ Async Architecture** – Lightning-fast async/await with connection pooling and automatic retry logic
- **🎨 Clean Web Interface** – Upload, process, and download files through an intuitive web interface, as satisfying as that perfect LEGO brick click
- **📚 Auto-Generated API Docs** – Swagger UI and ReDoc documentation built right in, like having the instruction manual always at hand
- **🏥 Health Monitoring** – Built-in health checks for production readiness, ensuring your creation stays sturdy
- **🐳 Dockerized Deployment** – Quick, containerized setup that works everywhere, following clear instructions like a LEGO manual
- **🔓 LibreTranslate Integration** – Powered by open-source LibreTranslate engine, because the best building blocks should be accessible to everyone
- **🔒 Enterprise Security** – Path validation, secure filename handling, and comprehensive input validation
- **🧪 Well-Tested** – 85%+ test coverage with comprehensive test suite

## 🧱 Getting Started - The Foundation Pieces

### Prerequisites - Tools You'll Need

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) - Your primary building tool
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - For connecting the pieces

### Installation - Assembly Instructions

1. **📦 Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BondIT-ApS/open-xliff-translator.git
    cd open-xliff-translator
    ```

2. **⚙️ Configure Your Environment** (optional):
    The application comes with sensible defaults, but you can customize settings by creating a `.env` file:
    ```bash
    # Copy the template
    cp .env.template .env

    # Edit with your preferred values
    nano .env
    ```

    **Available Configuration Options:**
    - `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
    - `APP_PORT`: FastAPI application port (default: 5003)
    - `UPLOAD_FOLDER` / `PROCESSED_FOLDER`: File storage directories
    - `LIBRETRANSLATE_URL`: Translation service endpoint
    - `DEFAULT_TARGET_LANGUAGE`: Default translation target (ISO 639-1 code, default: da)
    - `HTTP_TIMEOUT` / `MAX_RETRIES`: HTTP client settings

    See `.env.template` for full documentation of all available options.

3. **🚀 Assemble the Solution**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
    Just like that final satisfying "click" when LEGO pieces connect, your containers are now running!

4. **⏳ Wait for health checks** (about 45 seconds):
    ```bash
    # Watch the logs
    docker logs -f open-xliff-translator
    ```

5. **🎯 Access Your Translator**:
    - **Web Interface**: http://localhost:5003
    - **API Documentation (Swagger)**: http://localhost:5003/docs
    - **API Documentation (ReDoc)**: http://localhost:5003/redoc
    - **Health Check**: http://localhost:5003/health
    - **LibreTranslate**: http://localhost:5002

## 🎮 Usage - Playing with Your Creation

### Web Interface

1. Open **http://localhost:5003** in your browser
2. Upload your `.xlf` file using the clean interface
3. Watch as the file is automatically processed and translated
4. Download your translated file with a single click

It's like building with LEGO - simple steps that create something amazing!

### API Usage

```bash
# Upload and translate a file
curl -X POST http://localhost:5003/upload \
  -F "file=@your-file.xlf"

# Response:
# {
#   "message": "File processed successfully",
#   "download_url": "/download/translated_your-file.xlf"
# }

# Download the translated file
curl -O http://localhost:5003/download/translated_your-file.xlf

# Check service health
curl http://localhost:5003/health
```

### Interactive API Documentation

- See detailed error codes
- Try out file uploads directly in the browser

## 🧰 Project Architecture - The Building Design

Just like a well-designed LEGO set, this solution consists of several key components:
